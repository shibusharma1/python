# Step 1: Importing Tkinter

# The first step is to import the Tkinter module, which is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. 
# You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your Python script:

import tkinter as tk

# Step 2: Creating the Main Window

# Next, you need to create the main window of your application. This is done by creating an instance of the Tk class:

root = tk.Tk()



# Step 3: Running the Application

# Finally, you need to start the application's main loop using the mainloop method:

root.mainloop()
